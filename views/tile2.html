<p>As a homeowner you know that cleaning your tile and the grout area between can be challenging. The dirty, dingy or stained grout lines between the tiles are very difficult to get clean on your own.</p>  <img class="textleft img-thumbnail" src="images/tile2.jpg"></img> <p> Normal mopping of a floor pushes around the dirt and leaves a dirty detergent residue in the grout lines. Detergent residue acts as a magnet for more dirt, and left unattended can eventually stain your grout beyond cleaning. </p>  <img class="textright img-thumbnail" src="images/tile1.jpg"></img> <p> That’s why you need a professional cleaning company like Clean Path Solution. We have a powerful extraction cleaning system specifically designed for tile and grout that incorporates heat, cleaning agents, vacuum and a high pressure rinse. This system will loosen deeply embedded soil from fine crevices and porous grout removing the dirt that homeowners can’t remove with traditional cleaning methods.</p>
